    - Only draw background blocks when visible, no need when a real block is infront

    - Make climbing smoother (want to climb whenever holding w and moving over a ladder, currently it just 
    does this when you stand over then press w)

    - lighting currently breaks when torches are destroyed
    - Add colour to lights
